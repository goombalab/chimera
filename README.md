# Chimera

This repository provides the **official implementation of [Chimera: State Space Models Beyond Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12111)**.  
Chimera generalizes State Space Models (SSMs) beyond 1D sequences to operate directly on any data topology â€” including **language**, **images**, and **graphs** â€” through a unified formulation based on the **resolvent of the adjacency matrix**.
